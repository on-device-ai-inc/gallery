## What is OpenSpec?

OpenSpec is a **deterministic specification methodology** that eliminates all ambiguity from software specifications.

**Goal**: Two independent engineering teams can rebuild OnDevice AI **identically** without asking clarifying questions.

**Method**: Every value is explicit, every algorithm is pseudocode, every threshold is exact, every source is cited.

---

## Project Statistics

**Total**: 285 pages, ~14,000 lines

**Coverage**:
- ✅ 14 screens documented
- ✅ 8 state machines with diagrams
- ✅ 12 algorithms with pseudocode
- ✅ 92 colors (Material Design 3)
- ✅ 142 string resources (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- ✅ 38 asset files (1.89 MB)
- ✅ 15+ error types
- ✅ Complete offline behavior
- ✅ Full security specifications

---

## How to Use

### For Product Managers
Read specifications to understand current implementation → Define new features using same level of detail → Hand off to engineering with zero ambiguity

### For Engineers
Copy pseudocode algorithms directly → Implement using exact thresholds → No design decisions needed

### For QA/Testers
Derive test cases from state machines → Verify exact thresholds → Check error messages match What+Why+Action format

### For Designers
Use exact typography (Nunito, 8 weights) → Apply color tokens (92 total) → Follow spacing system (4dp base) → Match existing patterns

---

## Deterministic Guarantee

**Every value sourced from code**:
- ✅ Exact thresholds: 3,072 tokens (not "mostly full")
- ✅ Exact formulas: `tokens = text.length / 4`
- ✅ Exact dimensions: 54dp, 24dp, 72dp (not "medium", "rounded")
- ✅ Exact colors: #FF0B57D0 (not "blue")
- ✅ File paths with line numbers for all values
